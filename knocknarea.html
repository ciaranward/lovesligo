        <h2>Knocknarea, Co. Sligo</h2>
   <p>Take the neatly paved path from the car park. The walk to the summit of the mountain takes an average of 40 to 45 minutes. Once you reach the top there lies the cairn of Queen Maeve of Connacht. The cairn is about 10 metres high and is visible for miles around. It has not been excavated, but it is thought to cover a passage tomb similar to that of Heapstown Cairn. Queen Maeve and Knocknarea Mountain are mentioned in several of Yeats' poems and are of keen interest in Irish myth. There are spectacular views around County Sligo.</p>
   <p>On the summit of Knocknarea is a large cairn about 55 metres (180 ft) wide and 10 metres (33 ft) high, making it the largest such cairn in Ireland outside the Brú na Bóinne complex in Meath. Although it remains unexcavated, and is one of the biggest of such monuments still unexplored, it has many of the features of a classic passage tomb. It is known in Irish as Meascán Méabha or Miosgan Meadhbha meaning Medb's Lump (Miosgán means a lump or pat, especially of butter). In English it is known variously as Medb's Cairn, Medb's Tomb, Medb's Nipple or Medb's Grave (sometimes the name Medb is anglicized as Maeve). It is believed to date to around 3000 BCE. Meabh is a figure in Irish mythology who features in stories dating to the early first millennium CE. Archaeologist Stefan Bergh, in his book Landscape of the Monuments (Stockholm 1995), suggests that a large depression some distance to the west of the mound was the quarry from which the limestone for the monument was taken.<a href="https://www.gotoireland.today/knocknarea.html">Find more here</a>

    <h2>Benbulben Mountain, Co. Sligo</h2>
<p>You will climb Benbulben and get a birds eyes view of Yeats Country and final resting place of Sligo's famous poet WB Yeats. On a day with good visibility you will enjoy stunning views of Donegal Bay, Slieve League and the Blue Stacks Mountains in County Donegal. Further afield it is possible to see Croaghpatrick in County Mayo emerging in the horizon.

    The hike to Benbulben commences at Lukes Bridge and the ascent route climbs gently up the gully and to the summit plateau. We will visit a magnificant cave at Cartronwilliamoge on our way to Benbulben Trig and after a short trek we arrive at the head where we will feast on the stunning views of the surrounding countryside and enjoy some well deserved refreshments before returning back to the valley. 
</p>
<h2>How to get there</h2>
<p>Park up at Lukeâ€™s Bridge, 5km north of Drumcliffe, to begin your Benbulben adventure. Walk past glacial tracks, wild gullies and babbling streams as you make your way to the flat-topped summit. Look out for unique flora and fauna, including Fringed Sandwort which dates back to the Ice Age.

    The Benbulben Loop Trail, on the forest road, brings you to a striking waterfall where you can enjoy panoramic views of Sligo Bay and on a clear day, Donegal in the distance.

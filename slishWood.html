    <h2>Slishwood, Co. Sligo</h2>
    <p>Slish Wood features prominently in the poetry of William Butler Yeats, although he refers to it as ‘Sleuth Wood’ in his poem ‘The Stolen Child’.
        This site was once that of an extensive oak wood and although the area was sadly cleared during World War II (1939 – 1945), pockets of 250-year-old oak remain and patches of Norway spruce, Sitka Spruce and pine have since filled in the gaps in the forest. The remains of this oak woodland can still be seen along the lakeshore. Native wildlife includes mute swans, ducks and herons, while blackbirds, thrushes, larks and pigeons. Given the rich diversity of flora and fauna to be found at this location, Slish Wood is a designated bio-diversity site forming part of the Lough Gill Natural Heritage Area (NHA).

    <p>This 3Km loop trail is along the southern shore of Lough Gill and offers excellent views of the lake and surrounding country side. It forms part of the Sligo Way which passes through this forest. Species of trees which can be seen include Norway spruce, Scots pine, beech and oak.
This can be walked or can be a scenic drive. Close to the route of the Wild Atlantic Way and taking in the beauty of Lough Gill and surrounding countryside..</p>

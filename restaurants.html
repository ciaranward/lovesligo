    <h2>Flipside, Sligo</h2>
    <p>Flipside is a stylish burger bar serving top-quality burgers, prepared on the spot using only the freshest ingredients. Flipside never loses perspective of quality and good value for money. From day one, black and white branding and the tagline ‚ÄòSerious Burgers‚Äô reflected the simplicity of what owners Paul and David set out to achieve. In October 2018, after months of preparation and right in the heart of Sligo Town, Flipside opened its doors. More and more Sligo was becoming the most happening scene in northwest Ireland, it was the perfect setting for this new concept for the town. Many other cafes and pubs had burger offerings on their menus, but none were putting them front and centre. Flipside is an independent burger shop that is spacious and bright, playing upbeat music day and night. The burgers are seriously tasty, the cold beer satisfies, and the sides & shakes are deliciously addictive. If you want a party atmosphere by night, or a happy chilled hang out for the family by day, this is the place. Leave your worries at the door and dive into the Flipside. 
    FLipside take bookings for large groups only (of 6 or more people), email hello@flipside.ie for confirmation, or DM them on social media. Walk-ins are welcome and will be seated as quickly as possible, at the busiest times Flipside have a large waiting area with a bar where you can wait and have a drink.

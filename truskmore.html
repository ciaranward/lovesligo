    <h2>Truskmore, Co. Sligo</h2>
    <p>Truskmore Mountain is the highest point in County Sligo and County Leitrim. Truskmore is part of the Dartry Mountains. The Dartry Mountain range also includes Benbulbin and Benwhiskin. Benbulbin has a distinctive shape formed through Glacier movement during the ice age.

        Truskmore mountain has two county high points on the summit. County Sligo high point is beside the TV mast compound and sits at an altitude of 647m. Leitrimâ€™s county high point is about 200m away from the TV mast and on the edge of a steep vertical drop and sits at an altitude of 631m.</p>
        <h2>Getting to Truskmore</h2>
        <p>The access road to the TV mast that is used to climb to the Summit of Truskmore mountain is located on the Gleniff Horseshoe driving loop. The looped drive brings you underneath the bottom of Truskmore and along the bottom edge of the valley. If time allows, there is an old mill along the loop that is a perfect location for a small picnic area. When we reached the RTE Tv mast access road we noticed that there is limited space to park our car safely. We squeezed in beside the gate on the edge of the road and the grass ditch. There is only enough room here for 1-3 cars maximum, so come early to avoid dissapointmenrt.

    <h2>Rosses Point, Co. Sligo</h2>
    <p>Visit County Sligo and stop off at the seaside village of Rosses Point. Drop by the harbour and admire the picturesque backdrop of Sligo Bay and the Dartry Mountains. Take a walk along the stunning Rosses Point Coastal Trail and after, unwind with a luxurious seaweed bath at the tranquil Eros Spa. Play an exciting round of golf at the renowned County Sligo Golf Club, or travel to nearby Inishmurray and explore the ruins of an early Irish monastic settlement. <A href="https://www.discoverireland.ie/rosses-point">Find more here</A> </p>
    <p>Set on the “Wild Atlantic Way” there are lovely views of Knocknarea to the south and Benbulben to the north.  From the “Discovery Point” views extend out to Coney Island, Oyster Island and the wild Atlantic Ocean beyond.

        Largely undeveloped this area is a haven for wildlife. There is a colony of grey seals in Sligo Bay and dolphins, porpoises, basking sharks and even whales are occasionally spotted.
        
        The bay is popular with windsurfers and other water-sports enthusiasts, and in summer the beach is an excellent choice for family excursions.
        
        The area has a variety of interesting historic sites.  The wrecks of three ships from the Spanish Armada in 1588 were found offshore in 1985. Nearby Elsinore House (now derelict) is where literary giant W.B. Yeats and his artist brother Jack used to holiday. 
        
        There are some interesting monuments to see here too.  Close to the Sligo Bay lifeboat station is the heart-wrenching “Waiting at Shore” monument, built in memory of those lost at sea. Offshore, the Metal Man, a 3.7 metre guardian statue built in 1821 points out a safe course for seafarers into the harbour. 
        
        This is a place to come for long, scenic walks at any time of year.  Stay for the sunset and then retire for a pint at one of the friendly pubs in the village. <a href="https://www.thebeachguide.co.uk/republic-of-ireland/county-sligo/rosses-point.htm">Find more here</a> </p>
